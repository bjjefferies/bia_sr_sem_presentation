## Data

Cleaning:

1. There was one initial error in the dataset in the 'Accept Date' column. The column was incorrectly formatted as numeric and needed to be adjusted by adding to the Excel Origin 1899-12-30.

2. In offered_aid_amount, NA's need to be converted to $0

```{r warning=FALSE}
#find local files
local_files <- list.files(path = here())

# restrict list of local files to those ending in .xlsx
local_files <- local_files[grepl(pattern = ".xlsx$", x = local_files)]

# read in to dat
dat <- readxl::read_xlsx(here(local_files))

dat <- janitor::clean_names(dat)
```


```{r}
# clean accept_date column, numeric values are days added to the Excel origin
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(accept_date = as.Date(accept_date, origin = "1899-12-30"))

# convert all NA's in offered aid to $0
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(offered_aid_amount = round( ifelse(is.na(offered_aid_amount), 0, offered_aid_amount), 0))

head(dat)
```

## Time Exploration

What is the average length of time between a student's admit date and the date they accept their admission?

Data issues: There are some student for whom the reported date for accepting their offer came before their reported date of admission.  Need: investigate admission data process.

```{r}
# create column with calculated days elapsed between admit and accept
dat <- dat %>% 
  mutate(accept_time_elapsed = as.numeric(accept_date - as.Date(admit_date)))

dat %>% 
  group_by(residency, ipeds_ethnicity) %>% 
  summarize(avg_accept_time = mean(accept_time_elapsed, na.rm = T))
```


hypothesis:  Increasing Financial Aid will cause students to accept their NAU offer sooner.

Result: A statistically significant result showing the opposite trend, higher aid offers actually cause an increase in time from admission to acceptance. Student with no aid offer accepted in 68 days on avg, while each $1000 of aid awarded resulted in an extra 3 days of time between admission and acceptance.

```{r}

lm_aid_accept_time <- lm(formula = dat$accept_time_elapsed ~ dat$offered_aid_amount,
                         data = dat,
                         subset = !is.na(dat$accept_date))

summary(lm_aid_accept_time)
```


```{r}
lm_aid_accept_time$coefficients[2] * 1000
```


```{r}
dat_accepted <- dat[ !is.na(dat$accept_date), ]

plot(x = dat_accepted$accept_time_elapsed, y = dat_accepted$offered_aid_amount)
```


Explore data where accept date was before admit date (impossible).

Possible explanations: 1.  Students were admitted at an earlier date and accepted, but then re-applied.
```{r}
dat %>% 
  filter(accept_time_elapsed <= 0)
```







Research Questions:

1. does increased fin aid increase acceptance? Decrease time from admit to accept?
2. Does fin aid increase prob of acceptance?
3. Does fin aid increase 1 year retention rate?  (should discuss retention as key strat given enrollment cliff)
4. What does the admit to accept funnel look like for residents vs. non-residents?
5. are admit rates reflective of NAU's institutional goals?
6. How does household income impact admit, accept and retention rates?
7. How many more students would be admitted if we were to lower admit threshold by .25 HS GPA
